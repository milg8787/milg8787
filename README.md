### Hi there 👋


🔭 I'm currently working on a pizza website. Its build with the django framework which runs python. I already set up a masterpage with different pages. 

🌱 I’m want to learn something about website technologies. What kind of technolgies I can use and are easy to combine and useful.

⚽️ My hobbies are different kind of sports like soccer, surfing, climbing and mountaineering.
